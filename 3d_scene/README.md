# 3D Scene Assignments
You may think of this last chunk of work as one assignment in four parts, or four assignments that build on the same code base. Either way, the intended result is the same:
* A 3D graphics framework of your design, with rudimentary geometry, transformation, and lighting features
* An interactive 3D scene that is implemented with this framework

The multipart aspect of these assignments motivates a different way to disseminate the instructionsâ€”they are included here as links to the public _assignments_ repository for this class:

- [Assignment 0407a](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi371-spring2017/assignments/blob/master/static-3d-scene.md) Static scene based on polygon mesh library
- [Assignment 0407b](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi371-spring2017/assignments/blob/master/matrix-library.md) Matrix library with test suite
- [Assignment 0502a](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi371-spring2017/assignments/blob/master/lights-camera.md) Lights, cameraâ€¦
- [Assignment 0502b](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi371-spring2017/assignments/blob/master/action.md) Action! (animated, interactive 3D scene)

Welcome to the world of 3D graphics! Hope you enjoy your visit ðŸ™‚
